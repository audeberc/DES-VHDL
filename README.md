# DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD - VHDL
---

FPGA implementation of the Data Encryption Standard algorithm, witten in VHDL.
This module is not fully pipelined and thus targeted at low logic-block occupancy rather than maximal performances.

### Module Architecture

### FSM 

### Key computation

### Crypto block

### Synthesis report

#### Area report : 
  978 register blocks, 511 LUT => less than 1% of Cyclone V SoC 5CSEMA5F31
